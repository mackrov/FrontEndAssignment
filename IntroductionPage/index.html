                use different class name, but we have to wrap them in two
                 divs ,first time when we don't have it twice, display:flex 
                 is called on column class and it will convert all direct child into columns
                 but here only 2 direct child are found, 1 is section's main content
                 and the other one is aside's sidebar class, since list are inside the section
                 they are grouped together in the column, 
                 when we create a new div class of column(same name here) this one's direct
                 child are div class col-left and col-right, we had to group them in different div
                 else they will be grouped as single column when display:flex is called on columns
